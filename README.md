## :rocket: Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)\* (at least 18.18.0)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)\* (at least 10.8.2)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/)\*

* To run locally, you will need to have a MySQL database running on your machine or remotely on port 3306 (be sure to update the credientials in the `.env` file).

* You need `Expo CLI` installed on your machine. You can install it by running the following command:

```sh
npm install -g expo-cli
```

- To run the app on your phone, you will need to have the `Expo Go` app installed on your phone. You can download it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US). Scan the QR code generated by the `npm start` command to run the app on your phone.

- To run the app on an emulator, you will need to have the Android Studio installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Android Studio website](https://developer.android.com/studio). Check out [React Native Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) for more information on how to set up your environment to run the app on an emulator.
